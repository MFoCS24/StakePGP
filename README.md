# üîê PGP Identity Staking System

<h4 align="center">
  A decentralized application for securing digital identities through economic incentives
</h4>

Built on [üèó Scaffold-ETH 2](https://scaffoldeth.io), this project implements a PGP key validation system using economic staking to ensure authentic digital identities.

## Overview

The PGP Identity Staking System allows users to:

- Stake ETH against their PGP public key as a guarantee of authenticity
- Challenge potentially fraudulent identities
- Earn rewards for successful identity verification
- Integrate with existing PGP infrastructure
- Verify identities through a transparent, decentralized process

## Key Features

- üîë **PGP Key Staking**: Users can stake ETH to validate their PGP identity
- üí∞ **Economic Incentives**: Rewards for honest behavior and penalties for fraud
- üîç **Challenge System**: Allow community verification of suspicious identities
- ‚ö° **Quick Verification**: Immediate validation of staked identities
- üåê **PGP Integration**: Works with existing PGP infrastructure
- üîí **Secure Design**: Built on Ethereum with robust smart contracts

## Technical Architecture

The system consists of:
- Smart contracts for stake management and verification
- Integration with Ubuntu keyserver
- Web3 frontend for easy interaction
- Challenge/response verification system
- Real-time identity status checking

## Requirements

Before you begin, you need to install the following tools:

- [Node (>= v18.18)](https://nodejs.org/en/download/)
- Yarn ([v1](https://classic.yarnpkg.com/en/docs/install/) or [v2+](https://yarnpkg.com/getting-started/install))
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/downloads)

## Quickstart

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/MFoCS24/StakePGP
```

2. Install dependencies:
```bash
yarn install
```

3. Run a local network:
```bash
yarn chain
```

4. Deploy the contracts:
```bash
yarn deploy
```

5. Start the frontend:
```bash
yarn start
```

Visit your app on: `http://localhost:3000`

## Smart Contract Overview

The main contract `StakePGP.sol` implements:
- Staking mechanism for PGP keys
- Challenge/response system
- Verification logic
- Economic incentive structure
